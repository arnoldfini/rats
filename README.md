# rats

Pure experimentation, giving a computable solution to a math problem.

### Setting: 
Given one cat in the middle of a circle of rats (first of them is a white rat), the cat starts eating one rat then skips rats till the kth rat, which is eaten. This is done multiple times until there is one rat left.
The objective is to find such "k" that leaves the white rat as the last rat with n rats.
